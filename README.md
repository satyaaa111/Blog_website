# Blog_website
These are the files to create a blog website. mainly focused on the use of routing , ejs templates and mongoDB
you can add any blog from main_url/compose
after publishing it it will be shown in home page also with truncated version of your original blog
tapping to read more you can actually open the blog fully
to open the full blog there is another way you can simply go to the url : main_url/(your blog heading using kebab case)
The data will be saved to a database named postsDB 
That's all . Thank you
